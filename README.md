## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Master's thesis in Statistics where I am developing a method of estimating a time-dependent covariance matrix for use in portfolio optimization. Together with the thesis, we will release an R-package that will make implementation simple and straight forward, the repository will soon be made public so keep an eye out!
- ðŸŒ± I am also learning SQL and Python in order to become a more well rounded data scientist.
